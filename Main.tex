    \section*{Summary}
    
        Artificial Intelligence (\cool{AI}) has become popular in the past five years. Several industries has realized that capabilities such as pattern recognition and forecast, can help their applications to be more robust and efficient.  Artificial Intelligence has remained the same since the late 90's. Neural networks have different architectures such as multi layer feed-forward, and activation functions such as a simple hyperbolic tangent. There are training and learning strategies. Depending on the training strategies a computer can behave intelligent or not. Back propagation is a well know strategy. However, if the neural network is complex with several layers and nodes, the algorithm can take several hours or days to train. Some of the state of the art accelerators are software base. They focus on how to make the training algorithm more efficient. Other state of the art accelerators are based on Graphics Processing Units (GPU). GPUs are specialize silicone that are optimize for linear algebra usually used to create real-time graphics. Because of its fast linear algebra capabilities it can train networks between 3 to 7 times faster if only a Central Processing Units (CPU) is used. However, as neural network become more complex, GPUs and software accelerators become obsolete and hours of computational time turn into an extensive task. Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have developed technologies named \cool(HxC), a cutting-edge architecture based Field Programable Arrays.
